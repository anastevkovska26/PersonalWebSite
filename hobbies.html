                    One of my hobbies is reading. <br>
                    I have loved reading since I was a little girl.<br>
                    It makes me calm, happy and with every book I can learn something new.

                    I have been playing guitar since I was 8 years old.<br>
                    I started playing together with my brother because he wanted to, but I continued because I wanted to. <br>
                    Now I love playing the guitar, and I play at every family gathering.

                I have been playing chess since I was a little girl. <br>
                I started playing with my father. <br>
                It makes me happy every time I play, because I remember those days.

                    I have been singing since I was a little girl. <br>
                   I have always loved singing. <br>
                   I sang in a choir in elementary and high school, but I started singing more seriously when I was 11 years old.

                <p>
                    Painting calms me down. <br>
                    Whenever I need peace and quiet, I listen to some soft music and start painting, <br>
                    then I feel the most comfortable.
